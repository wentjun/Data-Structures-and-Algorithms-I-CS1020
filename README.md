## Data Structures and Algorithms I CS1020

##Introduction

Hi everyone, I took CS1020 at NUS School of Computing in AY2014/15 Sem 2, taught by Mr Aaron Tan. Feel free to take a look at my code; these are the take-home lab and practice lab assignments which I attempted.

##Disclaimer

- My solutions are not perfect. You can definitely come up with something better!
- Try your best not to plaguarize and submit my solutions, if the lab questions are repeated :)
- Released under the MIT License, so do take a look at it if you're not sure what it means
